                                  Veterinary Management System


This project involves the development of an API that enables a veterinary clinic to manage its own operations.

The application is intended for use by veterinary clinic staff. With this application, the staff can:

Register veterinary doctors,
Record the working days (available days) of doctors. The registration can be made with the date only, without specifying the time,
Register customers,
Register animals belonging to customers,
Record vaccinations administered to animals, along with their dates,
Schedule appointments for animals with veterinary doctors,
Specify both the available days of the doctor and perform a date and time check without overlapping with existing appointment records while creating an appointment.
(You can see the UML diagram below for the application.)
